<h3>Simulated Location, Virtual Location, Fake Location, Mock GPS</h3>

The <strong>"Wukong Virtual Location"</strong> APP is a tool that helps users simulate geographic location information. It is available for the Android platformâ€”simply download the APK and install it.

By using <strong>"Wukong Virtual Location"</strong>, users can select any location and simulate it, creating the illusion of being genuinely at the simulated location.

The primary purpose of developing this application is to assist Android developers in more realistically simulating location and trajectory information when developing LBS (Location-Based Services), thereby reducing development costs.
